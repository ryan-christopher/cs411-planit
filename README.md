For the Yelp Fusion API, you can obtain an API key by logging into your Yelp consumer account, then going to Developers>Yelp Fusion>Manage App

For the Graphhopper API, create an account to receive an API key (the free tier is sufficient). 

For Google OAuth access, please send your email address to jayfont@bu.edu to be added to the project so that you can sign into Google through our app.
