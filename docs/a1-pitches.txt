Pitch #1:
For our project, we would like to create a webapp that gets a user's location, asks them for their 
preferences of what they want to do, and a list of suggested activities would be presented to them 
determined from their input. The application could suggest an activity like a concert nearby if a 
user wants to go to something music related, a park if they want to do something outside, or a 
restaurant if they want to get something to eat. In addition to their input, local weather would also 
influence what might be suggested, so in summer it wouldn’t recommend going snowboarding and playing 
basketball outdoors wouldn’t be recommended during a storm. Our API calls would include items like what 
the weather would be depending on the users location through a service like WeatherAPI, estimates on 
how long it would take to walk, bike, or take a train through a service like the V3 API from MBTA, and 
local restaurants and businesses through the Yelp API.

Pitch #2:
Another project that we find interesting is a webapp that tackles the issues associated with streaming 
through platforms such as Twitch or Youtube and music being played during a stream. Streamers often 
like to play music that they enjoy during their time broadcasting to their audience, however DMCA strikes 
and copyrighted music can often get them into legal trouble. Our app would document what is being played 
during a stream, determine if record labels need to be attributed, and properly display that information 
while a song is being played. Music would be gathered and documented through an API such as Spinitron 
(a playlist management and documentation system) and Shazam, and we would use the Spotify API to create 
ready-for-streaming playlists for users depending on their preferred musical genres.
