# Assignment 2: User Story 4

## As a music listener I want to easily search for concerts in order to see my favorite bands when they are in town.

I have always enjoyed going to concerts when I have the chance to, but finding artists I want to see can be a hassle. Having to look up the schedules of each venue, then having to go to a different site to see ticket prices makes me want to not go in the first place. Now I can go to the app, select the option “I want to see a concert,” and choose a date for when I want to attend a concert. Then I’m presented with a list of artists performing near me on that day. I’ll be able to see who is playing, on what days, and at which concert venues so I can see the full picture of the music scene. That way I won’t be locked into one venue just because I am familiar with it. From there I can go straight to the link to purchase tickets and I no longer have to deal with juggling venue websites.
