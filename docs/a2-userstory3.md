# Assignment 2: User Story 3

## As a traveler I want to know of popular areas near my location in order to maximize my time on a vacation, regardless of the weather conditions during the time of my trip.

One of the hardest things about planning a trip is developing the itinerary. More difficult is changing the itinerary last minute when the weather ruins my plans. Rather than scrambling to find a venue on apps like Google Maps, Yelp, and others, the app allows me to access all the information I need in one place. To find an activity, I navigate to the website, put in my activity preferences, location, and distance preferences. What I then receive is a list of potential activities within my set distance based on my preferences and the weather at that location. This will allow me to choose as many activities as I want, letting me make the most of my hard-earned vacation. By putting in my preferences, the app will check the surrounding area for locations and the weather, ensuring that I never end up at the beach on a rainy day again.
